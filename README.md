# awesomely-java
A collection of sample programs in Java. This is the accompanying repo for my blog at https://awesomely-java.blogspot.com/

Structure of this repo is maintained in sync with the blog structure, with year and month folders followed by the topic discussed in the blog post. 

Within each topic there are several folders depending on the no. of posts on that topic in that month. 

This was created for my own reference. Sharing it, just so if it could be of use for any of you out there...
